    "A crucial aspect of working effectively with lists in Python is understanding how Python applies its internal indexing\n",
    "structure to lists. For this assignment you will be creating, searching, and sorting lists you will create from the contents\n",
    "of a small CSV file using some of the concepts we are learning about this week. Then, you will defining, instantiating and\n",
    "searching Python class objects constructed from that same CSV file.\n",
    "Start by downloading the cars-sample35.txt file to your local environment.\n",
    "Then, open a new Jupyter Notebook and copy in the following small Python code snippet:\n",
    "____________________________________________\n",
    "### be sure to update the path below to reflect your own environment!!\n",
    "### also be sure that the code is properly indented after you paste it!\n",
    "### print each row as read by the csv.reader function\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "with \n",
    "```open('yourpath/cars-sample35.txt') as csvfile:\n",
    "     readCSV = csv.reader(csvfile)\n",

    "         print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "_____________________________________________\n",
    "This code will read the contents of a CSV file you specify in a line-by-line manner and print the contents of each line in\n",
    "the form of a Python list. Each item within that list will contain the corresponding element of the comma-separated line\n",
    "within the CSV file from which it came.\n",
    "Once you've run the code snippet, you will see that each line of the file contains seven distinct values. For example, a\n",
    "print of the result of reading the first line will show the following:\n",
    "['high', 'high', '2', '4', 'med', 'low', 'unacc']\n",
    "These seven distinct values represent attributes of a single type of automobile. Specifically we have the following:\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "- Maintenance cost\n",
    "- Number of doors\n",
    "- Number of passengers\n",
    "- Luggage capacity\n",
    "- Safety rating\n",
